<h3>Mel</h3>
<p>Like her namesake which translates to "honey" in Portuguese, Mel is really really sweet.</p>
  <p>She is always super friendly and cuddly, especially if you're wearing black clothes!</p>
  <p>She lives in Rio de Janeiro and loves ramming her head into things.</p>

  <h3>Gordo</h3>
  <p>Gordo is a chubby boy (his name actually means "fat boy" in Portuguese) who loves to
    have meaningful conversations.</p>
    <p>He is quite demanding when it comes to petting and scratching, he will keep following you and
    hurting you until you give him some love.</p> But once you start, he will never let you go, scratching and clawing at you if you ever stop. </p>
    <p>He lives with Mel yet rarely ever interacts
    with her, he prefers human contact.</p>
