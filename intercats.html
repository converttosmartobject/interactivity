<h3>Mel</h3>
<img src="mel1.jpg" alt="Mel" width="500" height="333">
<p>Like her namesake which translates to "honey" in Portuguese, Mel is really really sweet.
  She is always super friendly and cuddly, especially if you're wearing black pants!
  She lives in Rio de Janeiro and loves ramming her head into things.</p>
